# Spacetime Physics, Chapter 6

One event cannot cause another when their spatial separation is greater than the distance
light can travel in the time separating the events.

Light speed sets a limit on causality.

No known physical process can overcome this limit: not gravity, not some other kind of
field, not a zooming particle of any kind.

"Spacetime interval" quantifies this limit on causality. Interval between far-away events
-- unlike distance between far-away points -- can be zero.

### 6.2 Relation between events: Timelike, Spacelike, Lightlike

Spacetime interval between events in Lorentz geometry is defined as:

$$
(\text{interval})^2 = (\text{time separation})^2 - (\text{space separation})^2
$$

This can be **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**.

Depending on whether the time part predominates or the space part predominates, interval
can be:

#### Timelike

$$
(\text{timelike interval})^2 = \tau^2 = (\text{time})^2 - (\text{distance})^2
$$

Time part predominates. For example, sequence of sparks emitted by a moving sparkplug.

Same two sparks registered in different frames? Same timelike interval.

Invariant hyperbola opens along the time axis.

Among all conceivable frames, which one records the smallest time separation?
The one in which the two events occur at the same place.

#### Spacelike

$$
(\text{spacelike interval})^2 = s^2 = (\text{distance})^2 - (\text{time})^2
$$

Space part predominates. For example, two events that occur at the same time in some
frame but at different places.

Same two events registered in different frames? Same spacelike interval.

Invariant hyperbola opens along the space axis.

Among all conceivable frames, which one records the smallest space separation?
The one in which the two events occur at the same time. This is called the
**proper distance** between the two events.

For a pair of events with spacelike separation, labels **"before"** and **"after"** have
no invariant meaning. They are frame-dependent (Example: figure above).

No particle -- not even a flash of light -- can move between two events connected by
a spacelike interval.

Two events separated by a spacelike interval cannot be causally related.

#### Lightlike

$$
(\text{lightlike interval})^2 = 0 = (\text{time})^2 - (\text{distance})^2
$$

Light like interval (**Null interval**).

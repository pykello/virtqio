# Spacetime Physics, Chapter 7

The combination of the motion descriptive quantities (momentum and energy) of two colliding
bodies is **conserved**. We call this combined quantity momentum-energy or **momenergy**.

### 7.2 Momenergy Arrow

Magnitude of a particle's momenergy is its mass. Momenergy is a directed quantity.

**Momenergy is a 4-vector:** Momenergy is 4-dimensional vector in spacetime:

  - Three space components: representing momentum in 3 spatial directions.
  - One time component: representing energy.

Particle momenergy **points along the particle's worldline** in spacetime.
It points in the direction of particle's spacetime displacement.

Momenergy exists independently of reference frames. Particle wristwatch measures proper time for that displacement.

The resulting expression is:

$$
(\text{momenergy}) = (\text{mass}) \times \frac{(\text{spacetime displacement})}{(\text{proper time for that displacement})}
$$

The **unit 4-vector** (spacetime displacement / proper time) defines and measures the direction
of the worldline displacement, and therefore the direction of the momenergy 4-vector.

**Law of Momenergy Conservation:** Total momenergy before reaction = total momenergy after reaction.

Since we measure time and space using the same units, momenergy has the same unit as the
first factor: mass. This means we measure momentum and energy using the same unit: mass.

### 7.3 Momenergy Components and Magnitude

_Spacetime location_ of an event unites time and space. Similarly, the single idea of
_momenergy_ unites momentum and energy.

When we choose a reference frame,

- The space components of momenergy give the momentum in that frame.
- The time component of momenergy gives the energy in that frame.

The calculus version of this is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E &= m \frac{dt}{d\tau} \\\\[0.5em]
p_x &= m \frac{dx}{d\tau} \\\\[0.5em]
p_y &= m \frac{dy}{d\tau} \\\\[0.5em]
p_z &= m \frac{dz}{d\tau}
\end{aligned}
$$

Then we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
(\text{magnitude }&\text{of momenergy arrow})^2 \\\\[0.7em]
\quad &= E^2 - p^2 \\\\[0.5em]
\quad &= E^2 - p_x^2 - p_y^2 - p_z^2 \\\\[0.5em]
\quad &= m^2 \left( \frac{dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2}{d\tau^2} \right) \\\\[0.5em]
\quad &= m^2 \left( \frac{d\tau^2}{d\tau^2} \right) \\\\[0.5em]
\quad &= m^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Since mass of a particle is invariant and we have $m^2 = E^2 - p^2$, then
assuming $p_y = p_z = 0$, the momenergy 4-vector for a single vector as observed
from different frames form a hyperbola in the energy-momentum plane:

Length of these arrows in the Lorentz geometry is invariant: always equal
to the mass of the particle.

Momenergy 4-vector of a material particle is always **timelike**. It always lies
in the same spacetime direction as the particle's worldline. The events along
the worldline have a timelike relation: Time separation exceeds space separation.

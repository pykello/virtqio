# Spacetime Physics, Chapter 4

Canopus is 99 light years away. If I have 40 more years to live, can I go
there and back within my lifetime?

### 4.3 Faster than light?

Assume we travel in a straight line in a rocket ship, and there are stations
along the way every light year from Earth. Their clocks have been synchronized
with Earth.

We start at July 4th, 2000. When we arrive at the 8th station, its clock reads
July 4th, 2010. Our clock reads July 4th, 2006.

Have we covered 8 light years in 6 years? **Are we traveling faster than light?**

The inconsistency: We measured the distance in the Earth frame, but the time
in the rocket frame. **We can only talk about the speed in one reference frame.**
We get nonsense if we mix measurements from different frames.

In the **rocket frame**,

- distance covered with respect to the rocket = 0 light years
- time took to cover that distance in the rocket frame = 6 years

Then, speed relative to the rocket frame = 0 light years / 6 years = 0.

In the **Earth frame**,
- distance covered with respect to the Earth = 8 light years
- time took to cover that distance in the Earth frame = 10 years

Then, speed relative to the Earth frame = 8 light years / 10 years = 0.8 light-speed.

### 4.4 All of Space is Ours!

Moving at 80% of light-speed, we travel 8 light years in the Earth-linked frame in
6 years of our rocket time.

Continuing at this speed, we can reach Canopus in **74 years of our rocket time**.
Better than 99 years, but not good enough.

**Relevation:** If we go fast enough, we can get to Canopus in 5 minutes of our
rocket time if we want!

In fact, no matter how away an object lies, and no matter how much time we have, nothing
in principle prevents us from covering that distance in the allotted time.

Just note that distance here is **Earth-frame distance**, and time is **rocket-frame time**.

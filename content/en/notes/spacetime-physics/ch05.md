# Spacetime Physics, Chapter 5

The concept of time does not apply to location in spacetime. It applies to individual
history of travel through spacetime.

Previously, we saw the following example: In a rocket moving relative to the lab, we
emit a light flash (event E) at the origin, which is reflected from a mirror and then
received back at the origin (event R).

We had 3 frames:

1. Rocket frame
2. Lab frame
3. Super-rocket frame, which moves to the right with respect to the rocket.

Observed from 3 different frames:

In the figure above, squares, circles, and triangles represent the latticework of
recording clocks in the rocket, lab, and super-rocket frames.

Take event E as the reference event. Since the spacetime interval is invariant,
event R must lie on a hyperbola. As we can see in the following spacetime maps:

**Invariant Hyperbola:** Locus of same event in all frames.

Spacetime arrows in all three maps connect the same pair of events. They embody the
same spacetime reality. In a deeper sense, these three arrows represent **the same
arrow in spacetime**.

Spacetime maps of different observers show **different projections** of the **same
spacetime arrow**.

### 5.4 Worldline

The moving particle traces out a line on the spacetime diagram: its **worldline**.

Until now we focused on pair of events. Now we shift our attention to a whole
chain of events that track the passage of a particle through spacetime: its **worldline**.

# Spacetime Physics, Chapter 5

The concept of time does not apply to location in spacetime. It applies to individual
history of travel through spacetime.

Previously, we saw the following example: In a rocket moving relative to the lab, we
emit a light flash (event E) at the origin, which is reflected from a mirror and then
received back at the origin (event R).

We had 3 frames:

1. Rocket frame
2. Lab frame
3. Super-rocket frame, which moves to the right with respect to the rocket.

Observed from 3 different frames:

In the figure above, squares, circles, and triangles represent the latticework of
recording clocks in the rocket, lab, and super-rocket frames.

Take event E as the reference event. Since the spacetime interval is invariant,
event R must lie on a hyperbola. As we can see in the following spacetime maps:

**Invariant Hyperbola:** Locus of same event in all frames.

Spacetime arrows in all three maps connect the same pair of events. They embody the
same spacetime reality. In a deeper sense, these three arrows represent **the same
arrow in spacetime**.

Spacetime maps of different observers show **different projections** of the **same
spacetime arrow**.

### 5.4 Worldline

The moving particle traces out a line on the spacetime diagram: its **worldline**.

Until now we focused on pair of events. Now we shift our attention to a whole
chain of events that track the passage of a particle through spacetime: its **worldline**.

Events exist independent of any reference frame. A worldline strings these events
together. The worldline also exists independent of any reference frame.

In the top diagram we have trajectories of 5 particles in space (not spacetime).

In the bottom diagram, we see their worldlines in spacetime. Only the event 1 has
a sample set of event points that are connected to form the worldline.

Note that the line drawn in the spacetime diagram is not the worldline itself. It is
**an image** of the worldline. The worldline in spacetime stands above and beyond
any particular image of it.

In the latticework of clocks, each clock records when a particle passes it. Each clock
record shows the location and time of the **event of coincidence**.

In this example, each of the particles move in a straight line in space with constant speed.
In the lab spacetime map their positions after 3 meters of time lie along the upper
horizontal **line of simultaneity**.

Below we see curved lab worldline of a particle that changes speed as it moves back
and forth along a straight line in space.

The particle initially moves to the right, then comes to rest at event Z, and then
accelerates to the left in space until it arrives at event P.

Some possible worldlines available to the particle after event P are shown. Since a particle
cannot exceed the speed of light, its possible worldlines has a limit of -45 to +45 degrees
from the vertical.

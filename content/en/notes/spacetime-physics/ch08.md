### Mass of a System of Particles

Energies add, momenta add, masses do not add.

**Heat is a system property.** Heat resides not in individual particles, but in the
system of particles. Heat arises not from motion of one particle, but from relative
motions of two or more particles.

The mass of a system is **greater** when system parts move relative to each other.

Remember that $E^2 - p^2 = m^2$.

In the example below, we have two non-interacting particles, each with mass 8. Taken
together as a system, their total mass is 20.
$M_\text{system} = (E_\text{system}^2 - p_\text{system}^2)^{1/2} = 20$.

Ask where the _extra_ $20 - 16 = 4$ units of mass are located? Silly question.

Ask where the $20$ units of mass are located? Good question. The 20 units of mass
belong to the system as a whole, not to any part individually.

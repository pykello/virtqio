# Spacetime Physics, Chapter 9

Galileo and Newton viewed motion as properly described with respect to a rigid
global Euclidean reference frame. Within this frame, there is the mysterious
force of gravity. A foreign influence which is not described by geometry.

Einstein says there exists no mysterious "force of gravity". Only the structure
of spacetime itself.

Complications arise in describing the relation between:

1. The direction of motion of a particle in one local frame, and
2. The direction of the same particle as observed from a nearby local frame.

Any difference between the two directions is described as a **curvature of spacetime**.

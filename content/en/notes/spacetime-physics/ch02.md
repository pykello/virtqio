### 2.2 The Intertial (Free-Float) Frame

Einstein's revolutionary idea: **Eliminate gravity!** (locally, using free-float frames)

The same ball thrown in the same direction with the same speed.

- Left: Observer with a floor pushing up against their feet.
- Right: Observer in free fall (free-float).

In both descriptions, the ball arrives at the same place -- relative to earth -- at the same time.

If we are in a **free-float frame**, the ball has straight-line motion.

Even when the room was not cut away from the cliff, the floor did not affect the
midair flight of the ball. But the floor did affect us who watched the motion.

**What happens when we let go of a pencil?**

It remains at rest -- as observed by the free-float frame!

The question is: "Before I let go, why must I apply an upward force to keep the pencil
at rest?"

Answer: Because we are making observations from an unnatural frame: one held fixed
at the surface of the earth.

### 2.3 Local Character of Free-Float Frames

A reference frame is called **Inertial** or **free-float** or **Lorentz** frame ...

- ... in a certain region of space and time
- ... when throughout that region and within some specified accuracy:
   - every free test particle initially at rest with respect to the frame remains at rest
   - every free test particle initially in motion with respect to the frame remains in
     motion without change of speed or direction. 

A free float frame is "local" in the following senses:

- It is limited in space and time.
- Its free-float character can be determined within, locally.

Newton's first law is the "Law of Inertia". For Newton, **inertia** was a property of
objects that described their tendency to maintain their state of motion.

Here, we have turned the "law of inertia" around. Before we certify a frame as
inertial, we _require_ observers in that frame to demonstrate that every free
particle behaves inertially.

Therefore, Newton's first law _defines_ a reference frame in which one can study
the motion of particles.

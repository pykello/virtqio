### 2.2 The Intertial (Free-Float) Frame

Einstein's revolutionary idea: **Eliminate gravity!**

The same ball thrown in the same direction with the same speed.

- Left: Observer with a floor pushing up against their feet.
- Right: Observer in free fall (free-float).

In both descriptions, the ball arrives at the same place -- relative to earth -- at the same time.

If we are in a **free-float frame**, the ball has straight-line motion.

Even when the room was not cut away from the cliff, the floor did not affect the
midair flight of the ball. But the floor did affect us who watched the motion.

**What happens when we let go of a pencil?**

It remains at rest -- as observed by the free-float frame!

The question is: "Before I let go, why must I apply an upward force to keep the pencil
at rest?"

Answer: Because we are making observations from an unnatural frame: one held fixed
at the surface of the earth.

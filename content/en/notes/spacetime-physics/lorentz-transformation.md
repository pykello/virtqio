# Special Topcic: Lorentz Transformation

Layout of the physical world can be described in two equivalent ways:
- Using events and intervals between them.
- Or isolated events described by their spacetime coordinates (latticework of recording clocks).

**Lorentz transformation** translates event description from lattice of one inertial
frame to that of another inertial frame.

### L.2 Faster than light?

If I fly at 4/5 the speed of light and fire a bullet that observe to fly forward at
4/5 the speed of light, isn't the bullet flying at 8/5 the speed of light relative
to the observer on the ground?

No. Velocities don't simply add. The speed the observer will measure will be 40/41
the speed of light.

How did we get this result? Using **Lorentz transformation**.

Space and time separations between two events typically don't have the same values in
different inertial frames.

Here the events are:
- Event 1: bullet is fired
- Event 2: bullet strikes a target ahead

Using the invariance of the spacetime interval, we can calculate the separations in
the frame of a passenger on the bullet. But to get the separations in the frame of
the observer on the ground, we need **Lorentz coordinate transformation equations**.

### L.3 First Steps

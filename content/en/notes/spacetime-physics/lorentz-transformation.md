# Special Topcic: Lorentz Transformation

Layout of the physical world can be described in two equivalent ways:
- Using events and intervals between them.
- Or isolated events described by their spacetime coordinates (latticework of recording clocks).

**Lorentz transformation** translates event description from lattice of one inertial
frame to that of another inertial frame.

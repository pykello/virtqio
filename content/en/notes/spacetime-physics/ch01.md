# Spacetime Physics, Chapter 1

### 1.1 Parable of Surveyors

This section talks about Daytime and Nighttime surveyors, who measure coordinates differently:

- Daytime surveyors use **magnetic north** and **magnetic east** as their reference directions.
- Nighttime surveyors use **North Star north** and **North Star east** as their reference directions.

Both use north directions in the sacred unit **miles** and east directions in **meters**.

This brings confusion when they want to compare the bounds of a property.

Then someone figures out that if **k** meters = 1 mile, then the following value is
invariant for both surveyors:

$$
\left[ 
  k \times
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \text{northward} \\\\
    \text{separation} \\\\
    \text{(miles)}
  \end{pmatrix}
\right]^2
+
\left[
  \begin{matrix}
    \text{eastward} \\\\
    \text{separation} \\\\
    \text{(meters)}
  \end{matrix}
\right]^2
$$

where both northward and eastward separations are measured from the center of the town square.

This is the **principle of invariance of distance**.

### 1.2 Surveying Spacetime

The Parable of Surveyors illustrates the naive state of physics before the discovery
of **special relativity**.

Similar to the surveyors, physicists before the 20th century used different units to measure
space and time:
- Space was measured in **meters**.
- Time was measured in the **sacred unit of seconds**.

We can use the same unit for both. Time in meters is just the time it takes for light
to travel that distance. The conversion factor is the speed of light **c**:

$$
c = 299,792,458 \text{ meters/second}
$$

**Time between events: Different for different frames**

In the surveyors parable, the northward readings as recorded by two surveyors
didn't differ much, since two directions of north were inclined to each other by
a small angle of 1.15 degrees. At first this seemed like a measurement error.

Analogously, with  the publication of Einstein's special relativity we learned that
the time between two events has different values for observers in different frames.

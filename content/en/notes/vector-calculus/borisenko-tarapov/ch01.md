### 1.2 Operations on Vectors

**1.2.1. Addition of Vectors**

* $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{A}$ (commutative law)
* $(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}) + \mathbf{C} = \mathbf{A} + (\mathbf{B} + \mathbf{C})$ (associative law)
* $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{A}$ (existence of zero vector)

The fact that a quantity is characterized by a magnitude and a direction is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for it to be a vector. For example, rotation of a rigid body
about an axis can be characterized by a line segment of length equal to the angle of
rotation and directed along the axis of rotation. As shown in the book, this quantity
does not add like a vector. See page 4.

**1.2.2. Subtraction of Vectors**

If $\mathbf{X} + \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{A}$, then $\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{A} - \mathbf{B}$.

**1.2.3. Projection of a Vector onto an Axis**

$A_u$, the projection of vector $\mathbf{A}$ onto axis $u$ is the **length** of the
segment cut from $u$ by the planes perpendicular to $u$ and passing through the
end points of $\mathbf{A}$.

**1.2.4. Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar**

* $m(n\mathbf{A}) = (mn)\mathbf{A}$
* $m(\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}) = m\mathbf{A} + m\mathbf{B}$
* $(m + n)\mathbf{A} = m\mathbf{A} + n\mathbf{A}$

### 1.3 Bases and Transformations

**1.3.1. Linear Dependence**

Vectors $\mathbf{A}_1, \mathbf{A}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{A}_n$ are said to be linearly dependent
if there exist scalars $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$, not all zero, such that

$$
c_1 \mathbf{A}_1 + c_2 \mathbf{A}_2 + \ldots + c_n \mathbf{A}_n = \mathbf{0} \tag{1.3}
$$

Two linear dependent vectors are _collinear_. Three linearly dependent vectors are
_coplanar_.

**1.3.2. Expansion of a Vector with respect to other Vectors**

Let $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ be two linearly independent (not collinear) vectors.
Then any vector $\mathbf{C}$ coplanar with $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, has a **unique
expansion**:

$$
\mathbf{C} = m\mathbf{A} + n\mathbf{B} \tag{1.6}
$$

with respect to $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$.

Same for three linearly independent (not coplanar) vectors $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{B}$, and $\mathbf{C}$. In three-dimensionsal space, any vector $\mathbf{D}$ can be uniquely expanded as:

$$
\mathbf{D} = m\mathbf{A} + n\mathbf{B} + p\mathbf{C} \tag{1.8}
$$

**1.3.3. Basis Vectors**

By a _basis_ for a three-dimensional space we mean any set of three linearly independent
vectors $\mathbf{e}_1$, $\mathbf{e}_2$, and $\mathbf{e}_3$.

Then any vector $\mathbf{A}$ will have a unique expansion:

$$
\mathbf{A} = m \mathbf{e}_1 + n \mathbf{e}_2 + p \mathbf{e}_3
$$


An **oblique coordinate system** with basis $\mathbf{e}_1$, $\mathbf{e}_2$, and $\mathbf{e}_3$:

If the basis vectors are mutually orthogonal and of unit length, the basis is called an
**orthonormal basis**. The coordinate system is then called **rectangular**.

  ![](fig1.8.jpg)

In the rectangular case we use $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ instead of $x^1$, $x^2$, and $x^3$ 
(reason explained in section 1.6), and use $\mathbf{i}_1$, $\mathbf{i}_2$, and $\mathbf{i}_3$
instead of $\mathbf{e}_1$, $\mathbf{e}_2$, and $\mathbf{e}_3$.

Position of a point $M$ is uniquely determined by the **radius vector** $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}(M)$.

Then $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ are **signed distances** between $M$ and the planes
$x_2Ox_3$, $x_3Ox_1$, and $x_1Ox_2$, and:

$$
\mathbf{r} = x_1 \mathbf{i}_1 + x_2 \mathbf{i}_2 + x_3 \mathbf{i}_3
$$

**Coordinate curves** are curves obtained by varying one coordinate while keeping the other two fixed.

In a rectangular coordinate system, the coordinate curves are straight lines parallel
to the coordinate axes.

As the basis, we choose **unit tangent vectors** to the coordinate curves at point $M$,

In a rectangular coordinate system, these are simply $\mathbf{i}_1$, $\mathbf{i}_2$, and $\mathbf{i}_3$,
and independent of the point $M$.

However, in **polar coordinates** the coordinate curves are:

* Circles centered at the origin
* Rays starting at the origin

In this case, $\mathbf{e}_R$ and $\mathbf{e}_\varphi$ vary from point to point, and always
intersect at **right angles**.

Coordinate systems whose basis vectors are mutually orthogonal are called **orthogonal systems**.

Coordinate systems whose coordinate curves are not straight lines are called **curvilinear systems**
(as opposed to rectangular or oblique systems).

Consider the **generalized polar coordinates** $u$ and $\theta$ whose coordinate curves are
ellipses:

In this cases, not only $\mathbf{e}_u$ and $\mathbf{e}_\theta$ vary from point to point,
but the angle between them also varies and in general is not a right angle.

# Chapter 2. The Tensor Concept

Scalars: **tensors of rank 0**. Vectors: **tensors of rank 1**. Since their specifications
in any coordinate system require $3^n$ numbers, called **components**.

Tensor is more than just a collection of numbers. Key property is the **transformation law**
of its components: The way components in one coordinate system relate to components in another
coordinate system. The transformation law is a consequence of the geometric or physical
meaning of the tensor.

Properly formulated physical laws are invariant under shifts and rotations of the coordinate system.


### 2.2 Zero Order Tensors (Scalars)

Scalars are quantities uniquely defined by a single number and **invariant under
coordinate system changes**.

**Examples:** Let $A$ and $B$ be two points in space, and let $\delta s$ be the distance
between them. Then $\delta s$ is a scalar.

For the time being, we confine ourselves to the rectangular coordinate systems.

Tensors written in rectangular coordinates are called **Cartesian tensors**.

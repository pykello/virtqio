# Chapter 2. The Tensor Concept

Scalars: **tensors of rank 0**. Vectors: **tensors of rank 1**. Since their specifications
in any coordinate system require $3^n$ numbers, called **components**.

Tensor is more than just a collection of numbers. Key property is the **transformation law**
of its components. This will be discussed in this chapter.
